Steps To solving problems using algorithm:

1) State the problem clearly. Identify input and output formats.
	i)Write the problem
	ii)Write the function with parameters
2)Come up with some example input and output. Try to cover all edge cases.
	i) Print the results to better understand how the params work.
	ii) Use Test Cases as dictionaries and try to cover all possible variations that may be encountered.
3)Come up with a correct solution in plain English.
	i)Implement the solution and test it using examples. Fix bugs, if any.
	ii) For testing: !pip install jovian --upgrade --quiet
			 from jovian.pythondsa import evaluate_test_cases
			 evaluate_test_cases(locate_card,test)
	iii)If there are errors print the inputs and the values of variables.
	cards6 = tests[6]['input']['cards']
	query6 = tests[6]['input']['query']

	locate_card(cards6, query6)
	evaluate_test_cases(locate_card, tests)
